Description: The package provides functions and workflows for conducting
    financial stress tests of listed equity, corporate bond and corporate
    loan portfolios.  It specifically focuses on climate change related
    risks, such as transition/policy risk, litigation risk and physical
    risk. The methodologies developed by 2DII focus on forward looking
    approaches and asset based analyses where possible. Some external
    stress tests are also featured.  This package is currently in the beta
    stage and not finalised yet. Changes to the methodology will still be
    made that can and will impact the outcomes of the analysis.
